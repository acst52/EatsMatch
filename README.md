## Description

Our web app, EatsMatch, is the place to go to save money when ordering in. No need to search through all the services to find the best price and coupon codes - EatsMatch allows users to compare food delivery prices from different services, such as UberEats and DoorDash, and automatically tells them where the price is right.
